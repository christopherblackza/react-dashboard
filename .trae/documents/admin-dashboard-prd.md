## 3. Core Process

**Admin Flow:**
Admins log in and access the main dashboard to view system-wide metrics. They can manage all clients, invite new team members, configure system settings, and access comprehensive analytics. Admins handle billing configurations, monitor subscription health, and manage user roles across the organization.

**Manager Flow:**
Managers access the dashboard to oversee their assigned clients and team performance. They can create and edit client records, generate reports for their department, send notifications to team members, and monitor client health metrics. Managers have limited admin functions for their specific organizational scope.

**Analyst Flow:**
Analysts focus on data analysis and reporting. They access read-only dashboards, generate custom reports with various filters, export data for external analysis, and create scheduled reports for stakeholders. They can view client trends and provide insights but cannot modify client data.

**Viewer Flow:**
Viewers have basic read-only access to view client information and basic metrics relevant to their role. They can access assigned client profiles, view notifications directed to them, and access limited reporting features based on their permissions.
